# Backlog

Here maintains a list of future TO-DOs:

### Features:
- Run the simulation experiments of reinforcement learning agents
- Support visualization of exerpiment logs (e.g. generate plots) 
- Allow agents to share food and water besides resources
- Introduce the role of predator
### Optimization:
- Water graphics could be smoother with animation
- When frontend render large maps, allow the sacrfise of local details during global view and only render ojects in sights during local view
### Bugs:
