##############################

Neural MMO `[Demo Video] <https://youtu.be/DkHopV1RSxw>`_ `[Github] <https://github.com/jsuarez5341/neural-mmo>`_ is a massively multiagent AI research environment inspired by Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGS or MMOs). The long-term goal of our platform is to enable artificial agents to scale to real world intelligence. MMOs are complete macrocosms featuring thousands of agents per persistent world, diverse skilling systems, local and global economies, complex emergent social structures, and ad-hoc high stakes single and team based conflict. Simulating the physical processes of evolution on Earth is computationally infeasible, but we can construct a reasonable and efficient facsimile: we consider MMOs the best proxy for the real world among human games.

**Getting Started:** Neural MMO extends the OpenAI Gym API to support additional environment complexity: persistence, large/variable agent populations, and hierarchical observation/action spaces. The quickest way to dive in is:

**1:** Read the `Quickstart <https://jsuarez5341.github.io/neural-mmo/build/html/overview.html#ags-quickstart>`_ tutorials

**2:** Skim the `Environment <https://jsuarez5341.github.io/neural-mmo/build/html/autodoc/forge.blade.core.api.html#forge.blade.core.api.Realm>`_, `IO <https://jsuarez5341.github.io/neural-mmo/build/html/autodoc/forge.blade.io.io.html#forge.blade.io.io.IO>`_, and `Infrastructure <https://jsuarez5341.github.io/neural-mmo/build/html/autodoc/forge.trinity.api.html#forge.trinity.api.Ascend>`_ modules of the `API Reference <https://jsuarez5341.github.io/neural-mmo/build/html/autodoc/modules.html>`_

**3:** Hack on your own projects using the `/projekt <https://github.com/jsuarez5341/neural-mmo/tree/master/projekt>`_ demo model as starter code

**4:** Join our `Discord community <https://discord.gg/BkMmFUC>`_ for help and discussion!

**5:** Contribute to the platform! Neural MMO is an active open source project

I actively review issues and pull requests. **Discord is the best way to contact me**

|ags| Overview
##############

**Agents that scale to the complexity of the real world** is one statement of general intelligence. A key perspective of this project is to decouple this task into research and engineering subproblems that, taken together, equal the original objective. The project is divided into four modules along these lines. See Ideology if you find this sort of macro view interesting.

Training from scratch
---------------------

Next, we will get familiar with the baseline parameters and train a model from scratch. Open up experiments.py, which contains all of the training configuration options. First, we'll disable the test mode flags:

.. code-block:: python

   LOAD = False
   TEST = False
   BEST = False

Our baseline was trained on a 12 core machine. Your CPU probably has fewer cores. To use 4 cores instead:

.. code-block:: python

   NGOD = 4

You may also want to reduce the batch size (CLUSTER_UPDATES). Now we can train a model:

.. code-block:: python

   python Forge.py

If you leave it running, you will see the reward steadily increasing:

|train|

This smoothed training curve was produced using the (beta) logging library. The baseline model gets to >28 average lifetime after training for several days on 12 cores. Once you are satisfied, enable testing flags and run with rendering enabled to view learned policies. As a sanity check, agents typically learn not to run into lava first, as indicated by the steep initial learning curve slope.

The IO API
----------

On the surface, Neural MMO follows the OpenAI Gym API:

.. code-block:: python

  #Core environment and configuration
  from forge.blade.core import Realm
  from experiments import Experiment, Config

  #Define an experiment configuration
  config = Experiment('demo', Config).init(TEST=True)

  #Initialize the environment and policy
  env                        = Realm(config)
  obs, rewards, dones, infos = env.reset()

  #Run policy
  actions = somePolicy(packet)

  #Submit actions
  nxtObs, rewards, dones, info = env.step(actions)

  #(s, a, r) tuple + rollout boundaries
  print(obs, actions, rewards, dones)

However, the actual contents of *obs, rewards, dones, info* is nonstandard by necessity. Gym isn't built for multiagent environments -- and certainly not for ones with complex hierarchical observation and action spaces:

|header|

You're free to develop your own methods for handling these, but we've already done all that work for you. Let's make use of the core IO libraries:

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 3,16,22

  #Core API
  from forge.blade.core import Realm
  from forge.blade import IO

  #Demo baselines
  from experiments import Experiment, Config

  #Define an experiment configuration
  config = Experiment('demo', Config).init(TEST=True)

  #Initialize the environment and policy
  env                        = Realm(config)
  obs, rewards, dones, infos = env.reset()

  #Process observations
  packet, _ = IO.inputs(obs, rewards, dones, config)

  #Run policy (fills packet object)
  somePolicy(packet)

  #Select actions
  actions   = IO.outputs(packet)

  #Submit actions
  nxtObs, rewards, dones, info = env.step(actions)

  #(s, a, r) tuple + rollout boundaries
  print(obs, actions, rewards, dones)

We're almost done. The IO API handles batching, normalization, and serialization. The only remaining issue is that *somePolicy* must handle hierarchical data and variable action spaces. Ethyr provides prebuilt IO networks:

|io|

This pair of attentional networks is responsible for flattening the input space and indexing the variable length action space. In particular, *a* is an embedding layer, *f* and *g* are soft attention subnetworks, and *h* is a hard attention subnetwork. You can read more about these in the v1.3 whitepaper. Let's use these modules to make this example runnable:

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 7,15,19,22

  #Core API
  from forge.blade.core import Realm
  from forge.blade import IO

  #Demo baselines
  from experiments import Experiment, Config
  from forge.ethyr.torch.policy import baseline

  #Define an experiment configuration
  config = Experiment('demo', Config).init(TEST=True)

  #Initialize the environment and policy
  env                        = Realm(config)
  obs, rewards, dones, infos = env.reset()
  policy                     = baseline.IO(config)

  #Process observations
  packet, _    = IO.inputs(obs, rewards, dones, config)
  flat, lookup = policy.input(packet)

  #Select actions
  policy.output(packet, flat, lookup)
  actions      = IO.outputs(packet)

  #Submit actions
  nxtObs, rewards, dones, info = env.step(actions)

  #(s, a, r) tuple + rollout boundaries
  print(obs, actions, rewards, dones)

And there you have it! You can insert your own model between the input and output networks without having to deal with nonstandard structured data. However, this only covers the forward pass. We haven't discussed rollout collection, training, or any population based methods. For a fully featured and well documented example, hop over to /projekt in the environment repo.

Distributed computation with Ascend
-----------------------------------

Ascend is a lightweight wrapper on top of the excellent Ray distributed computing library. The core paradigm is to model each *layer* of hardware -- cluster, server, core -- by subclassing the Ascend object. Let's first implement a remote client (Sword) without using Ascend. In order to keep track of several remote clients, we will also create a server (God).

.. code-block:: python

  import ray, time

  @ray.remote
  class Sword:
     def __init__(self, idx):
        self.idx = idx

     def step(self):
        time.sleep(1)
        return self.idx

  class God:
     def __init__(self, n=5):
        self.disciples = [Sword.remote(i) for i in range(n)]

     def step(self):
        clientData = ray.get([d.step.remote() for d in self.disciples])
        print(clientData) #[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

  if __name__ == '__main__':
     ray.init()
     God().step()

Ascend enables us to do all of this without manually writing loops over hardware:

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 1,13,15,18

  from forge.trinity.ascend import Ascend
  import ray, time

  @ray.remote
  class Sword:
     def __init__(self, idx):
        self.idx = idx

     def step(self):
        time.sleep(1)
        return self.idx

  class God(Ascend):
     def __init__(self, n=5):
        super().__init__(Sword, n)

     def step(self):
        clientData = super().step()
        print(clientData) #[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

  if __name__ == '__main__':
     ray.init()
     God().step()

The source is only a few hundred lines and isn't very useful in toy examples. Ascend really shines in more complex environments that already have too many moving parts:

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 1,10,22,24,25,26,27,30

  from forge.trinity.ascend import Ascend, runtime, waittime
  import ray, time

  @ray.remote
  class Sword(Ascend):
     def __init__(self, idx):
        super().__init__(None, 0)
        self.idx = idx

     @runtime
     def step(self, coef, bias):
        time.sleep(1)
        return coef*self.idx + bias

  class God(Ascend):
     def __init__(self, n=5):
        super().__init__(Sword, n)

     def update(self):
        time.sleep(1)

     @runtime
     def step(self):
        asyncHandles = super().distribute(
              2,
              [4, 3, 2, 1, 0],
              shard=(False, True))

        self.update()
        clientData = super().synchronize(asyncHandles)
        print(clientData) #[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

  if __name__ == '__main__':
     ray.init()
     God().step()

Like before, we have a server interacting with five remote clients. This time, the *coef* argument is shared among clients while the *bias* argument is sharded among them. Additionally, we are using the computation time of the clients to perform additional work in the server side *update()* function. And we are also logging performance statistics, specifically time spent performing useful computation vs time spent waiting, for both layers. The Neural MMO demo has a third infrastructure layer for the cluster. Even in this toy example, Ascend is saving us quite a bit of code.

In the full Neural MMO environment, we use three infrastructure layers, each of which subclasses Ascend:

|infra|

This simulates the traditional MMO computation paradigm in a research setting. Specifically, we run a cluster of servers, each of which simulates a copy of the environment and distributes agent computations among multiple remote clients. Ascend allows us to implement this framework pythonically in only a few lines of code.

|ags| Namesake
##############

In formal publications, we refer to our project simply as a (the first) "Neural MMO." Internally and informally, we call it "Projekt: Godsword" (God-Sword). The name comes from two sources: CD Projekt Red, my personal favorite game dev studio, and OldSchool Runescape, which contains an iconic set of weapons called godswords. The latter is a particularly good model for AI environments; the former is more of a soft flavor inspiration.

|ags| Version History
#####################

The `OpenAI <https://github.com/openai/neural-mmo>`_ only hosts v1.0. My `personal Github <https://github.com/jsuarez5341/neural-mmo>`_ hosts the latest version in *master* and all previous versions as separate branches. This documentation page is generated from the latest environment release. Feel free to drop in the Discord #support channel if you are having trouble. You can expect fast fixes to Github issues and even faster replies to Discord PMs.

**v1.3:** Prebuilt IO Libraries | `[Update Slide Deck] <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tqm_Do9ph-duqqAlx3r9lI5Nbfb9yUfNEtXk1Qo4zSw/edit?usp=sharing>`_ :download:`[Paper] <docs/source/resource/nmmo_v1-3.pdf>`
   - Blade: We have improved and streamlined the previously unstable and difficult to use IO libraries and migrated them here. The new API provides framework-agnostic IO.inputs and IO.outputs functions that handle all batching, normalization, serialization. Combined with the prebuilt IO networks in Ethyr, these enable seamless interactions with an otherwise complex structured underlying environment interface. We have made corresponding extensions to the OpenAI Gym API to support variable length actions and arguments, as well as to better signal episode boundaries (e.g. agent deaths). The Quickstart guide has been updated to cover this new functionality as part of the core API.
   - Trinity: Official support for sharding environment observations across multiple remote servers; performance and logging improvements.
   - Ethyr: A Pytorch library for dynamically assembling hierarchical attention networks for processing NMMO IO spaces. We provide a few default attention modules, but users are also free to use their own building blocks -- our library can handle any well defined PyTorch network. We have taken care to separate this PyTorch specific functionality from the core IO libraries in Blade: users should find it straightforward to extend our approach to TensorFlow and other deep learning frameworks.
   - Embyr: Agents now display additional information overhead, such as when they are immune to attacks or when they have been frozen in place.
   - A reasonable 8-population baseline model trained on 12 (old) CPU cores in a day.
   - Improved and expanded official documentation
   - New tutorials covering distributed computation and the IO API
   - The Discord has grown to 80+! Join for active development updates, the quickest support, and community discussions.

**v1.2:** Unity Client and Skilling | `[Update Slide Deck] <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G9fjYS6j8vZMfzCbB90T6ZmdyixTrQJQwZbs8l9HBVo/edit?usp=sharing>`_
   - Blade: Skilling/professions. This persistent progression system comprises Hunting, Fishing (gathering skills) and Constitution, Melee, Range, Mage (combat skills). Skills are improved through usage: agents that spend a lot of time gathering resources will become able to gather and store more resources at a time. Agents that spend a lot of time fighting will be able to inflict and take more damage. Additional bug fixes and enhancements.
   - Trinity: Major new infrastructure API: Ascend -- a generalization of Trinity. Whereas v1.1 Trinity implemented cluster, server, and node layer APIs with persistence, synchronous/asynchronous, etc... Ascend implements a single infrastructure "layer" object with all the same features and more. Trinity is still around and functions identically -- it has just been reimplemented in ~10 lines of Ascend. Additional bug fixes and features; notable: moved environment out of Trinity.
   - Ethyr: Streamlined and simplified IO api. Experience manager classes have been redesigned around v1.2 preferred environment placement, which places the environment server side and only communicates serialized observations and actions -- not full rollouts. Expect further changes in the next update -- IO is the single most technically complex aspect of this project and has the largest impact on performance.
   - Embyr: Focus of this update. Full client rewrite in Unity3D with improved visuals, UI, and controls. The new client makes visualizing policies and tracking down bugs substantially easier. As the environment progresses towards a more complete MMO, development entirely in THREE.js was impractical. This update will also speed up environment development by easing integration into the front end.
   - Baseline model is improved but still weak. This is largely a compute issue. I expect the final model to be relatively efficient to train, but I'm currently low on processing power for running parallel experiments. I'll be regaining cluster access soon.
   - Official documentation has been updated accordingly
   - 20+ people have joined the Discord. I've started posting frequent dev updates and thoughts here.

**v1.1:** Infrastructure and API rework, official documentation and Discord | `[Update Slide Deck] <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EXvluWaaReb2_s5L28dOWqyxf6-fvAbtMcBbaMr-Aow/edit?usp=sharing>`_
   - Blade: Merge Native and VecEnv environment API. New API is closer to Gym
   - Trinity: featherweight CPU + GPU infrastructure built on top of Ray and engineered for maximum flexibility. The differences between Rapid style training, tiered MPI gradient aggregation, and even the v1.0 CPU infrastructure are all minor usage details under Trinity.
   - Ethyr: New IO api makes it easy to interact with the complex input and output spaces of the environment. Also includes a killer rollout manager with inbuilt batching and serialization for communication across hardware.
   - Official github.io documentation and API reference
   - Official Discord
   - End to end training source. There is also a pretrained model, but it's just a weak single population foraging baseline around 2.5x of random reward. I'm currently between cluster access -- once I get my hands on some better hardware, I'll retune hyperparameters for the new demo model.

**v1.0:** Initial OpenAI environment release | `[Blog] <https://openai.com/blog/neural-mmo/>`_ `[Paper] <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00784.pdf>`_
   - Blade: Base environment with foraging and combat
   - Embyr: THREE.js web client
   - Trinity: CPU based distributed training infrastructure
   - Ethyr: Contrib library of research utilities
   - Basic project-level documentation
   - End to end training source and a pretrained model

|ags| Ideology
##############

The dual problem formulation mentioned in the Quickstart guide is core to the guiding ideology of the project. Depending on your own personal conception of where the field is as the moment, this may seem like a practical philosophy, AGI cultism, or anything in between. Regardless, see this `Two Pager <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_76rYTPtPysSh2_cFFz3Mfso-9VL3_tF5ziaIZ8qmS8/edit?usp=sharing>`_ for a more thorough overview of the project approach and objective.

The discussion of failure modes below is mostly intended to dissuade skepticism, which thus far I've found correlates perfectly with lack of familiarity with MMOs. If you are very familiar with MMOs + current AI research and are still skeptical, please contact me on the Discord -- I'd love to hear your views.

|ags| Failure Modes
-------------------

Evaluation can be somewhat difficult in our setting but is not a major blocker. For smaller experiments, we find population size and resource utilization to be reasonable metrics of success. For larger experiments with sufficient domain randomization, Tournaments (as described in the accompanying paper) allow for cross validation of approaches.

We are currently aware of three failure cases for the project:
  * Computational infeasibility
  * "Agents that scale to their environment" is too hard
  * "Environments that scale to the real world" is too hard

The first failure case is a serious risk, but is shared among all areas of the field. This project is not uniquely compute intensive -- in fact, it is one of few environments where it is straightforward to train reasonable policies on a single CPU. If scale is the main issue here, it is likely shared among most if not all other approaches.

The second problem is probably most familiar to researchers as exploration. Given a cold start, how can agents bootstrap both to better policies and to better exploration strategies? This is a hard problem, but it is unlikely to kill the project because:
  * This is independently an important problem that many researchers are already working on already
  * The environment of this project is designed collaboratively to assist agents early on in learning, rather than adversarially as a hard benchmark
  * `Recent <https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/>`_ `projects <https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/>`_ have demonstrated success at scale.

The third problem probably appears most likely to many researchers, but least likely to anyone who has spent a significant amount of time in MMOs. Here is a map of the NYC subway:

.. image:: docs/source/resource/quests.png
  :alt: Quest Map
`Source <https://www.reddit.com/user/Gamez_X>`_

Actually, it's a quest map of Runescape, a particular MMO that our environment is loosely based upon. Each quest is a puzzle in itself, takes anywhere from several minutes to several hours to complete, is part of an interconnected web of prerequisites of other quests, and provides different incentives for completion ranging from equipment to unlockable content to experience in a tightly connected set of skills:

.. image:: docs/source/resource/skills.png
  :alt: Skills

.. image:: docs/source/resource/equipment.png
  :alt: Equipment
`Source <https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/>`_

In a massive open world:

.. image:: docs/source/resource/map.png
  :alt: GameMap
`Source <https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/>`_

The most complex class of games considered to date is MOBAs (Massive Online Battle Arenas, e.g. Dota, Quake CTF), which are round based, take on order of an hour, and are mechanically intensive. Achieving 99 in all skills and acquiring the best gear in Runescape takes, at minimum, several thousand hours. In a tournament setting where attacking other players is allowed everywhere, moment-to-moment gameplay is less important than balancing the risks and rewards of any potential strategy--especially in the presence of hundreds of other players attempting to do the same. There is almost certainly still a complexity gap from MMOs to the real world, but we believe it is much smaller than that in environments currently available.

While our environment is nowhere near the level of complexity of a real MMO yet, it does contain key properties of persistence, population scale, and open-endedness. As agents begin to reach the ceiling of the current environment, we plan on continuing development to raise the ceiling.

I, `Joseph Suarez <https://github.com/jsuarez5341>`_, am the primary author of Neural MMO. I plan to continue development for at least the duration of my EECS PhD at MIT or until someone convinces me that there is a better way to solve AGI. Everything written in the source and documentation is my own opinion. I do not speak for OpenAI, MIT, Clare, Phillip, Igor, or anyone else involved in the project.

2019 (fall): Neural MMO development continues at MIT. as the main project of my PhD
   - I am continuing my role as the primary developer
   - **Phillip Isola** resumes project oversight as my adviser
   - We are beginning to get open source contributions

2018 (fall): Independent development results in v1.1 and v1.2:
   - I ran the project solo. These versions are derivative works and are MIT sublicensed in my name

2018 (spring): Neural MMO development continues during a 6-month internship at **OpenAI**, culminating in the v1.0 environment (MIT licensed to **OpenAI**) and THREE.js client (MIT licensed to **Joseph Suarez** and **Clare Zhu**) release:
   - I continued my role as the primary developer
   - **Yilun Du** assisted with running experiments and particularly in setting up tournaments for the v1.0 release
   - **Phillip Isola** and **Igor Mordatch** managed and advised the project
   - The v1.0 environment is registered to **OpenAI** and available under the MIT license
   - The legacy THREE.js client was developed independently as a collaboration between myself and **Clare Zhu**. It was originally created as follow-up work for the paper and blog post, but we ended up merging it in. This is also the reason that the project is split into two repositories. It is registered to us jointly and is available under the MIT license

2017 (summer): Neural MMO development begins:
   - I started Neural MMO as an independent side project
   - I (**Joseph Suarez**) retain ownership of this smaller original code base and game kernel, along with associated ideas. I created these before my affiliations with OpenAI and MIT
