Neural MMO is a massively multiagent AI research environment inspired by Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) role playing games. The project is under active development with major updates every 3-6 months. This README is a stub -- all of our `[Documentation] <https://jsuarez5341.github.io>`_ is hosted by github.io.
